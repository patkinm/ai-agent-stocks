# Database Simplification - Refactoring Summary

## Overview
Simplified the database structure from 3 collections down to 1 collection, making the codebase much easier to understand and maintain.

## What Changed

### Before (3 Collections):
1. **`analyses`** - Individual stock analyses
2. **`scans`** - Grouping metadata for batch analyses
3. **`comparisons`** - Prediction tracking data

### After (1 Collection):
1. **`analyses`** - Everything in one place!
   - Stock analysis data
   - Market data at time of analysis
   - Prediction tracking fields (updated later)

## Why This is Better

### Problems with Old Structure:
- ❌ `scans` collection was just grouping metadata - didn't add real value
- ❌ `comparisons` duplicated data already in `analyses`
- ❌ Required complex joins and multiple queries
- ❌ Confusing to understand what data lived where

### Benefits of New Structure:
- ✅ Single source of truth for all analysis data
- ✅ Simpler queries - no joins needed
- ✅ Easier to understand and maintain
- ✅ Prediction tracking built directly into analyses
- ✅ Reduced code complexity

## Files Changed

### Models
- `web/lib/models/analysis.ts`
  - Removed `ScanSession` interface
  - Removed `PredictionComparison` interface
  - Added prediction tracking fields to `StockAnalysis`

### Database Service
- `web/lib/services/database.ts`
  - Removed scan collection methods
  - Removed comparison collection methods
  - Added `updateAnalysisPrediction()` - updates analysis with actual price data
  - Added `getPendingPredictionUpdates()` - gets analyses needing updates
  - Added `getAnalysesWithPredictions()` - gets completed predictions
  - Added `getPredictionStats()` - calculates accuracy statistics

### API Routes Updated
- `web/app/api/analyze/route.ts` - Simplified to just save analysis
- `web/app/api/scan/route.ts` - Removed scan session creation
- `web/app/api/comparisons/route.ts` - Now works with analyses directly
- `web/app/api/ticker/[symbol]/route.ts` - Simplified query

### API Routes Deleted
- `web/app/api/scans/route.ts` ❌
- `web/app/api/scans/[id]/route.ts` ❌

### Frontend Pages Updated
- `web/app/page.tsx` - Removed PredictionComparison references
- `web/app/analyze/page.tsx` - Removed scanId state
- `web/app/comparisons/page.tsx` - Rewritten to use analyses directly
- `web/components/Navigation.tsx` - Removed "Scans" link
- `web/components/PredictionGraph.tsx` - Updated to use analysis fields directly

### Frontend Pages Deleted
- `web/app/scans/page.tsx` ❌
- `web/app/scans/[id]/page.tsx` ❌

## New Data Model

```typescript
interface StockAnalysis {
  // Core analysis fields
  symbol: string;
  decision: 'buy' | 'sell';
  confidence: number;
  current_price: number;
  target_price: number | null;
  analysis_timestamp: string;
  
  // Market data (captured at time of analysis)
  price_change: number;
  volume: number;
  rsi: number;
  // ... more market data fields
  
  // Prediction tracking (updated later)
  actual_price: number | null;              // Updated with current price
  actual_change_percent: number | null;     // % change from prediction
  prediction_accuracy: number | null;       // -1 to 1 score
  target_reached: boolean | null;           // Did it hit target?
  last_checked: Date | null;                // When was it last updated?
  days_elapsed: number | null;              // Days since prediction
  
  created_at: Date;
}
```

## How Prediction Tracking Works

1. **Analysis Created**: Analysis saved with prediction fields set to `null`
2. **Update Predictions**: Call `/api/comparisons` POST endpoint
3. **System Updates**: For each pending analysis:
   - Fetches current stock price
   - Calculates actual change %
   - Determines if prediction was correct
   - Updates the analysis record

## Navigation Structure

**Before:**
- Dashboard
- New Analysis
- Scans ← Removed!
- Predictions

**After:**
- Dashboard
- New Analysis
- Predictions

## Next Steps

If you want to further simplify:
1. Consider removing the `/comparisons` page entirely and showing prediction tracking directly in the Dashboard
2. Add automatic background job to update predictions daily
3. Add indexes on `symbol` and `created_at` fields for better query performance

## Database Migration

To migrate existing data (if needed):
1. No immediate action required - old collections will just be ignored
2. New analyses will use the simplified structure
3. Can delete old `scans` and `comparisons` collections when ready
